Auction House Ridwan H. Mohamud
For my semester project, I integrated an API developed by students at Noroff (see Noroff API Documentation). My focus was on the Auction House section, which aligned with the nature of my project. I utilized Figma for designing the layout and aesthetics of my website, ensuring a visually appealing interface. The site, named “Buy & Sell: Auction House,” was launched using Netlify, featuring a custom logo designed via logo.com to enhance brand identity.
The website's colors scheme centered around a blue theme with a white background, chosen for its clean and coherent visual appeal. For the development, I employed React for programming, supplemented by Tailwind as the styling framework. This combination facilitated an efficient and responsive design process.
The structure of the website was comprehensive, encompassing six distinct pages: a homepage, profile page, listing page, listing ID page, along with login and registration pages. To streamline the functionality, I created specific components for each data- fetching operation and tailored the code to suit the needs of each individual page.
The navbar of my website serves as the main navigation tool. It's built using React, with state management for menu visibility and user information like username, credits, and avatar. Initially, the navbar checks if a user is logged in by looking for an access token in local storage. If found, it also retrieves the user's name, credits, and avatar. The navbar has a dynamic design – for larger screens, it shows user information and navigation links directly, while for smaller screens, a hamburger menu icon appears for compact navigation. The logout function clears the user's data from storage, ensuring a secure sign-out process.
The Footer is simpler but equally important. It's designed with a consistent blue background and includes the company logo. For social engagement, icons for Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram are provided, each linking to the respective social media pages. The Footer also displays a copyright notice, ensuring the intellectual property of the
 Auction House Ridwan H. Mohamud website is protected. This section effectively rounds off the website, providing essential links and information in a clean and accessible manner.
The Home page of our website is where users can view all the latest auction listings. Right when you enter the page, it automatically shows you a list of the newest items up for auction. We've made sure that this list updates on its own, so you always see the most current offerings.
There's also a handy search bar at the top. This lets you quickly find exactly what you're looking for by typing in keywords. As you type, the page will only show listings that match your search, making it really easy to find interesting items.
The auction listings are displayed in a neat and easy-to-read format. Each listing has a picture, the title of the item, when the auction ends, and how many bids it has received. We've designed it so that you can see all the important info at a glance. Plus, if you want to know more about a specific item, just click on its listing, and you'll be taken to a page with all the details.
Overall, the Home page is straightforward and user-friendly, designed to give you a quick and enjoyable browsing experience.
On the Listing Page, users can easily create their own auction listings. It's a straightforward form where you can enter details like the item's title, description, and when the auction should end. You can also add tags and pictures. Once you submit your listing, it gets added to the auction site. We've made sure this process is simple and user- friendly, so you can focus on what you're selling, not how to list it.
The Listing ID Page is where the action happens for a specific auction item. When you visit this page, you'll see everything about that item - pictures, description, when the auction ends, and the current highest bid. If you're interested, you can place your own bid. The page makes sure your
bid is valid and within your budget. It's designed to be engaging and interactive, making the bidding process exciting and straightforward.
Our Profile Page is a personal dashboard for users on the auction site. When you go to your profile, you'll see the username, how many credits you have, and the profile picture. It's a quick way to check your details at a glance.
